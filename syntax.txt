# some builtin functions #
clear() # clears the terminal screen #
exit() # exits the program #
append(list_name, value_to_append) # similar to go's append function but you dont have to assign this to a variable #
# i am not gonna write down every built in function that the tutorial provides because there's a lot of them #
